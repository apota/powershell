Powershell tools for everyday programming

1. sql_table_differ: 

		Diff data in two RDBMS tables using ANSI SQL to generate CSV reports of rows added, deleted and columns 
		changed (with their old and new value listed). Comes in handy when you are about to import a large data 
		set on to your production table, you might want to compare the staging table with the live table.  

2. reverse_phone_lookup:

         Getting annoying spam calls? Popular Reverse phone lookup websites charge you money for letting you know who   
         the phone belongs to. The website https://theylookup.com/ can be scraped for FREE. If your phone number 
         is say 318-299-XXXX, thenj ust scrape the url https://theylookup.com/318-299.html as shown in the script with 
         the full phone number and the script will stop once it finds the full phone. An instance of IE is spawned 
         and the browser will stop at the page with the found phone number. You can watch the automated IE zoom 
         through the pages. It's fun to watch.
