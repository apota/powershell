2. reverse_phone_lookup:

        Popular Reverse phone lookup websites charging you money for letting you know who the phone belongs to?
        The website https://theylookup.com/ can be scraped. If your phone number is say 318-299-XXXX, then 
        just scrape the url https://theylookup.com/318-299.html as shown in the script with the full phone number
        and the script will stop once it finds the full phone. An instance of IE is spawned and the browser will
        stop at the page with the found phone number. You can watch the automated IE zoom through the pages. It'say
        fun to watch.
